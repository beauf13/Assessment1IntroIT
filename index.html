<p style="text-align:center;">Name: Beau Foster</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Student ID: S3930701</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Student email: <a href="mailto:S3930701@student.rmit.edu.au" style="color: LightGrey;">S3930701@student.rmit.edu.au</a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">My name is Beau Foster, I am 27 and currently live in Sydney, NSW.<br>I have a 1 year old son who means the world to me. His name is Lachlan and loves surprising me with new things everyday.<br>I was born in Katoomba, NSW, along with my twin sister Mariah. I am half Rotuman (small island near Fiji) and half Australian,<br>and was predominantly raised by my Mother after my parents split when we were young.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">At the moment I work in the construction industry doing Post-tensioning work, which I have been doing for the past 5 years.<br>I love my work along with the people I work with. In the past I completed my HSC, finished my certificate II in outdoor recreation,<br>and studied an associate course in Project Management (not completed due to personal situation at the time). Growing up I loved sports,<br>mainly basketball, which I competed at on various levels eventually making the state squad.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Interest in IT</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">My interest in IT started at a young age. I started off with playing games on my mumâ€™s PC,<br>but this quickly developed into taking apart the PC to look at the hardware and how everything worked. Over time I began tinkering<br>with different internal settings on the pc, including registries and BIOS settings, eventually moving on towards various software applications from python to AutoCAD.<br> Although I never spent a great deal on any particular application or field of IT, my interest in IT has always driven me to learn new things and take on different challenges.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I chose to study at RMIT as it provided the best way for me to explore my interest in IT and move towards a new career path in the future.<br>The option to study online at times that suited me was the icing on the cake, as it is difficult to juggle a full time job, a second job, and a family.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">During my studies at RMIT I hope to gain the necessary knowledge to move into a career in IT, so I can have the energy and time to spend more time with my family.<br>By the end of my studies, I expect that I will be proficient in coding in multiple languages, have a good understanding of the IT industry, and have the tools to continue to develop these skills further.</p>
