<h1 style="text-align:center;">Project Idea</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><em>Overview</em></h2>

<p>My project idea is to create a program that allows you to round up money from everyday purchases, then use that money to purchase cryptocurrencies of your choice. This program would have a website, along with a mobile app to allow for ease of use across multiple platforms.</p>

<p>This program will be designed to allow individuals to begin, or build on their cryptocurrency portfolios with ease. The purpose of the program is to create an option for people to increase their investments without affecting their personal financial situation in a big way.</p>


<h2 style="text-align:center;"><em>Motivation</em></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="stats.png" style="width="320" height="350"></div>
<p>My motivation behind creating this particular project is to create an easy way to slowly increase cryptocurrency holdings. In the past it has felt like you either need spare savings that you can go without, or to constantly move money into the exchange at set intervals. These things can make it difficult to enter or grow your investments, as it can create a feeling of leaving yourself short.</p>

<p>At the moment, interest in both crypto currency and blockchain technologies is increasing exponentially, with roughly 1 in 5 Australians having held cryptocurrency at some point. These statistics show the potential this program could have on the market.</p>





<h2 style="text-align:center;"><em>Description</em></h2>

<p>This project (which I have not yet come up with a name for) would have a variety of features to give the user an easy, streamlined experience. This is important as a frustrating user interface, or difficult to use features could create friction between people and the program, and this could lead to them walking away from it.</p>

<p>Users would be able to link a debit or credit card to their account that they wish to use to round up when purchasing goods. This would require a link between the financial institution and the program. To ensure the security of the user's card, the program would need to implement a read-only system to ensure that the program has no access to the card, or other financial details.</p>

<p>Once the card is linked to their account, they would then link their preferred crypto currency exchange account to the app. From here, they would be able to select which currency to purchase with their ‘spare change’.</p>

<p>The program would also include the options to turn on and off any rounding up if they wish to stop the process for any reason. On top of this, they would have the options to increase the rounding up of purchases. These options could include:
<ul>
<li>Next $1</li>
<li>Next $2</li>
<li>Next $5</li>
<li>Next $10</li>
</ul>
This approach would give the user flexibility with how much they wish to invest. These options, along with an easy to use mobile app would empower people to be in full control of how they wish to use the program.</p>

<p>Due to purchasing restrictions on exchanges that require a ‘minimum’ buy order, this program would use a system that would ‘bank’ the spare change from purchases and accumulate this over a set period of time at the user’s discretion. This could then be set to automatically purchase the selected currency on set intervals, e.g. 1 day, 2 days, 1 week, fortnightly etc. It would also have the option to send a notification to the user asking for permission to buy, or refund the spare change back into their nominated card.</p>

<p>Another feature would be to keep track of all the money that has been rounded up, as well as the money that has been invested into currencies. This would also have conversion tools that can convert different currencies, both fiat and crypto, to make it easy to see how much of a particular currency you would receive. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><em>Tools and Technologies</em></h2>

<p>Tools and technologies that would be required for this project are somewhat standard as this program would act as a link between other services. Firstly, the project would require a secure server to host their website. Depending on the size and foot traffic of this project, it could be acquired through a web hosting service provider, or build your own domain server from scratch. Both of these methods have pros and cons and these would need to be assessed before the project becomes publicly available.</p>

<p>Secondly, this project would require a mobile application. Once again, this can be built from scratch or by utilizing open-source tools such as the MIT App Inventor.</p>

<p>Thirdly, multiple programming languages would be used to create and implement the ideas for this project. These programming languages would be used throughout the project on multiple levels, and could make or break the end result.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><em>Skills Required</em></h2>

<p>The skills required to create this program would be to have a team of software developers with a good understanding of multiple programming languages, along with strong skills in security related programming. Having programmers that have security related programming skills are key to this type of program, as consumers want to make sure that their money is safe, and any unintentional people are going to be able to have access to that.</p>

<p>Finding a team with the required skills to complete this project should not be overly difficult. This may take some time due to the high demand of programmers in the workforce, but if the project is not on a strict deadline for completion then putting together the team should not be too difficult. The most difficult task would be acquiring a competent, driven team leader who can guide and help the rest of the team through any challenges they may face.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><em>Outcome</em></h2>
<p>If this project were to become successful, I believe that it has the potential to have a big impact on people who wish to enter, or strengthen their cryptocurrency portfolio. This can also grow peoples curiosities in the booming sector of blockchain technology which can help further along up and coming projects that could impact everyday life.</p>

<p>With the success of the project, I could incorporate more options in the future. Potential future options could include purchasing NFT’s, stocks, index funds, and even online gift cards to a variety of shops or services.</p>
