<h2 style="text-align:center;"><em>What do these results mean to me</em></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">The results of the above tests provide clarity on why I do some of the things I do.<br>Reading further into my results has given me tips on how to better study so as to not lose focus,<br>and shown me some things I need to be mindful of when talking and interacting with other people.<br>I found the Myers-Briggs test particularly interesting as it felt surreal how accurate the description of my personality was.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><em>How could these results influence my behaviour in a team</em></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Looking through the results of the above tests shows that although sometimes I can create a disturbance in the team<br> through arguments or competitiveness, it can simply be because I wish to challenge both myself and the team.<br>This can come across as a negative thing to others, but<br>because I want to do better as a team and also learn how other people are<br>thinking, and how they have come to their conclusions.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><em>How should I take this into account when forming a team</em></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">When forming a team I need to inform the others that although I can come across rude sometimes, my intentions are good.<br>I believe I would do better in a team that is varied with people from all walks of life,<br>as I would use those experiences to help create a stronger team.</p>
