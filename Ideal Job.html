<h2><em>What makes this appealing</em></h2>
<p>I personally find this sort of position appealing as I enjoy large scale projects, alongside the varied and complex nature of the work. As challenging as these projects may be, they can bring people together to overcome these challenges, and in turn, provides satisfaction of creating better products that meet the requirements of the end user. This creates a sense of accomplishment for everyone involved.</p>
<h2><em>skills , qualifications, and experience required</em></h2>
<p>These types of positions require a great deal of experience within the industry, hands on experience with multiple programming languages, experience with software security operations and design, along with years of managerial experience. It can also help to have experience managing a team across multiple time zones and/or countries, and experience communicating and addressing stakeholders and any issues they may have.</p>

<h2><em>Skills, qualifications and experience I currently have</em></h2>
<p>As I am only just starting to get involved with the IT industry, I currently have no experience working with programming languages, security operations or security design. Although I do possess a few years of management experience, this is all in small teams in a face to face environment.</p>

<h2><em>How will I achieve the above</em></h2>
<p>Firstly, I plan on completing my Bachelor of Information Technology course at RMIT. From there I plan on entering the Industry in a software related role to begin my new career in the IT industry. As time goes on, I wish to hone my skills and complete other training related to software development and engineering.</p>
